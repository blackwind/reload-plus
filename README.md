# Reload Plus [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9c9v0cxv78dhk8n3/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/blackwind/reload-plus/branch/master)

Reload Plus makes the following (user-configurable) changes to the behavior of Firefox's "Reload" button:

Left Mouse (or F5) = Standard Reload  
Ctrl+LMouse (or Ctrl+F5) = Override Cache  
Alt+LMouse (or Alt+F5) = Load Missing Images  
Shift+LMouse (or Shift+F5) = Google Cache  

Middle Mouse = Standard Reload (new tab)  
Ctrl+MMouse = Override Cache (new tab)  
Alt+MMouse = Reload Non-Pinned Tabs  
Shift+MMouse = Google Cache (new tab)  

Other available actions include "Reload All Tabs", "Reload Pinned Tabs", "Reload Unsuccessful Tabs", and "Set/Clear Retry Interval". These actions can be swapped in via the configuration dialog or accessed via context menu.

"Problem loading page"? Disabled by default, R+ can also be configured to automatically retry when it encounters most page loading errors. Give it a shot, then begin wondering how you ever lived without it!

NOTE: This add-on is designed to replace several aging extensions, such as "Reload", "Online Reload", "ReloadEvery", "Reload Non-Pinned Tabs", "Show Image", and "Show Picture". It's recommended you remove these and anything similar before installing R+.
